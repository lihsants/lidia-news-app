            <strong>Writer:</strong> <em>Small puff pastry with a flavored cream in the middle</em>
            <p></p>
            <p>This week I tried to get back to my old routine, which was going to bed early to wake up early and go to the gym, but my knee still feels weird, so when I work out, I just feel like I'm doing it all the time kkkkkk.</p>
            <p>I went back to writing my master's thesis. I took a break from looking for a job because it makes me very anxious and a little doubtful of myself, but two companies that I had already sent my CV to scheduled a call for tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Yesterday I had a very healthy dinner with Doritos and wine kkkkk.</p>
            <p>And I don't know how it is for you, but I can't stand January anymore kkkkk.</p>
            <p>Today I was really pissed because Iga, the second best tennis player in the world, lost, and ruined the perfect final that was supposed to be on Saturday.</p>
            <p>I think my PMS is starting yesterday, so I think I'll spend the weekend resting, I just plan on visiting my mother. I'm also trying to get the courage to redo my braids this weekend. I have a lot of hair... if we had a child, he'd be like the Itt from the Addams family hahaha</p>

            <p>And you, did you manage to get that girl to stop bothering you? When I went through a similar situation, I didn't even reply, I just archived the message to avoid more problems.</p>
            <p>What about theater studies? Does your church have a theater group?</p>
            <p>How's the weather there? Do you want me to send you about 5¬∞C from here? Haha</p>
            <p>I confess that on Sunday I was saddo knowing that I wouldn't have your attention like I used to. It was a bit selfish of me, I know rsrs, but who told you to be like Jesus? My mother teach me to always talk to Jesus, hahaha. But after a while I thought about it and realized that in less than 4/5 months neither you would come back here, nor would I be able to save up money to visit you, so I was calm again. Besides, it's a good time for us to get to know each other well, create a friendship, and it's good to know that someone is talking to me for more than just my body, not that I have a problem with that, I love my body and I love it when people are attracted to it, I love exchanging hot messages, but I don't like it when people just describe me as a big butt, you know? I've binge-watched all the Marvel movies to get a lot of content, and it's a waste to just describe me as a butt, even if it's big hahaha.</p>
            <p>Ahh, I saw another movie you sent me, Kal ho Na hoo. I know you said that Shah Rukh is a heartthrob in India, but I still think you're more handsome than him (and only my opinion matters lol.. I think I'll just watch one or two more and leave the rest for to watch by your side.</p>
            <p>And I know you must be wondering "why does this crazy girl still talk to me?! And do she still think we'll see each other again?!" hahaha but if you put up with me for another month, I'll tell you, if not you'll never knowüëÄ kkkkkk</p>
            <p>Well, next week I'll be back with more L√≠dia news hahah</p>

You're not eating the way you like, you spend the day working or studying, and it's cold there, which doesn't help you stay happy rsrs, and you're still without me, which I imagine must be the hardest part kkkk...

            <p>This week was tiring rsrs... I had the second phase of the interviews I did, I'm tired of telling you about my professional trajectory kkkk. I had to do two huge technical tests, I finished one this morning, at 3 am, and I just finished the last one now, before sending you this letter üò™. I'm dead and very hungry lol. And at work at the beginning of the week it seemed like nothing was going well. </p>
            <p>Aaanddd babe What's happening with the world in this 2 days?! Death in a religion ceremony in India, yesterday was a terrible rain here in Rio, the water in street was upper the bus, our cellphones in the streets received alert from the government... There in US had a unbelievable accident, the helicopter had already seen the plane from a distance, the control tower had already informed them and even so they collided ....

            <p>Funny thing is that this weekend I was on my period... and when I'm like that I get really clumsy... One time I went to a two-story store, but they put shelves with products on the stairs, can you believe I managed to knock over half of the shelves while I was trying to climb the stairs?! kkkkkk</p>
            <p>All I could do was look at the things on the floor and at the store saleswoman, who was killing me with her eyes kkkk... I tried to offer help, but she was so pissed off and scared, she just wanted me to not touch anything else kkkkkkkk. </p>
            <p>Then this weekend I got really sick with cramps, so I stayed with my mother on Friday and Saturday to be taken care of by her. Then one day I felt like eating fried cassava, so I went to cook it, forgot about it on the stove and the pan dried out. When I was frying it, I managed to make the oil splash and burn my arm... I got kicked in the face by my niece while she was sleeping, I went to walk in the yard, slipped and hurt my little finger, kkkkkk... I'm a walking danger to myself, with PMS... So I went back home and stayed quiet... I only went out on Sunday to make a delivery for my brother and to see a show that was on the beach. </p>
            <p>Sometimes I think life is so unfair... there are a lot of idiots guys after me, there are nice guys too, but it's hard to find someone who seems everything its fine, you know? The people I've met in the last few years are nothing like me, and there's a guy who's crazy like me, with a totally childish sense of humor like mine, who's good with the people around him, sees life in a beautiful way, like I do see it, who's confident in himself, who managed to see behind the big wall I have, a Man who made me sure of what I wanted, but he simply lives in another country, and a country with 300 bureaucracies to get into... Why life couldn't be a little easier sometimes rsrs</p>
            <p>Sometimes I feel like an idiot writing these letters, like Ted Mosby or in the movie The Lake House kkkkkk, and I also don't know if it's serving the purpose I wanted, of bringing us more closer, even in the midst of the crazy routine. But like the good Ted Mosby that I am, I have to believe in my fairy tale kkkk. And it's good to smile again when I see a message notification. My romantic soul hopes that these letters are helping my Sims continue building his house inside your heart kkkkkk. But if they're at least helping to make you smile in this difficult routine of yours, I'll be happy. üíõ</p>
